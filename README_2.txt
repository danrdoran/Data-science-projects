Deep Learning Project - Food Image Classification
***
- This project I developed as a part of MIT's Applied Data Science Program.
- In the project I develop some  models to help identify Deeping Learning Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models to classify images as Bread, Soup, or Fruits/Vegetables.
